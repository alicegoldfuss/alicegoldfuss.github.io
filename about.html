<img src="/images/skull-bio-square-blue-small.png" style="float:right; margin-left:10px">Alice Goldfuss is a Site Reliability Engineer at New Relic, where she spends her days wading through containers, comforting servers, and performing dark sacrifices to the network tier. She lives in Portland, OR, where she hosts PDX DevOps and avoids the sun. Alice enjoys speaking at conferences, writing short stories, and making terrible puns.

You can find her on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss" style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;" target="_blank">@alicegoldfuss</a>) ranting about feminism and posting pictures of spiders.
