<img src="/images/skull-bio-square-blue-small.png" style="float:right; margin-left:10px">Alice Goldfuss is a Site Reliability Engineer at New Relic, where she spends her days wading through containers, comforting servers, and performing dark sacrifices to the network tier. Sheâ€™s been a technical reviewer on <i>Docker: Up & Running</i> and <i>Effective DevOps</i> and bemused audiences on both sides of the pond. 
<br><br>
You can find her on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss" style="font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;" target="_blank">@alicegoldfuss</a>) drinking tea, ranting about feminism, and trying to kidnap every cat she meets.
